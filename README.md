About the game:

The idea of the game is that there is a ball rolling between three lanes and the goal is to collect the cube shaped coins in each lane. The ball is constantly moving forward but can be shifted to different lanes depending on the stretching position: stretching diagonally with the right hand higher than the left makes the ball move to the left and doing the opposite enables the user to move right.

In order to collect coins the band must be taut. Otherwise, the user is still able to switch lanes, but will pass through the coins and not gain points. An exception to this are the occasional blue coins worth only 1 point, included as a means to encourage users to engage with the game even if they are struggling to stretch during its entire duration.


Each game has a duration of 40 seconds. In the last 10 seconds of the game, the coins all switch color and their value increases, as an incentive for the player to keep stretching right up until the end.
